# voidscript

This is a script to install my config on a fresh void install.

It uses Lukesmith's fork of st and my own fork of dmenu.
Since this is only intended for personal use you would have to change the path to the Wallpaper in the i3config.

Installation Instuctions:

sudo chmod 777 voidsystem.sh

sudo ./voidsystem.sh
